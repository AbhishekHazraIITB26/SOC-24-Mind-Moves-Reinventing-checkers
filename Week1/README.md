# Week 1

Before we embark on your journey to make your own checkers bot, we begin by understanding one of the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence - neural networks.

In Week 1, you will understand the logic behind neural networks, and how we harness mathematics and computational power to solve many contemporary problems.

Below you will find links to various online resources to help you with this week's portion.

## Python Basics

You will mostly, if not exclusively, use only Python throughout this course. You are not expected to have an in-depth knowledge of the language, but an understanding of the data types and basic data structures like lists (similar to arrays in C/C++) and dicts (similar to structs), basic syntax for different types of loops, defining functions, reading from and writing to files, etc.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Instead of asking you to build traditional Python scripts, in this course you will be using **Jupyter Notebooks** to write and run your code.

Jupyter notebooks allow you to divide your code into multiple cells that you can run individually one-by-one, allowing you to debug your code much more easily. You can go over the first few sections of [**this introductory document**](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) or [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk) (only until Notebook creation and code execution).

For this course, you will be using [**Google Colab**](https://colab.google/) to run your notebooks on the cloud. Ensure that you have a Gmail account to use it.

## NumPy Basics

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a linear algebra library in Python. It is a very important library that many popular libraries for AI/ML and data science (like Mat−plotlib, SciPy) rely on.

What is it used for ?
NumPy is very useful for performing mathematical and logical operations on Arrays. It provides an abundance of useful features for operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python.

One of the main advantages of Numpy is that vectorisation using numpy arrays makes it super time efiicient. It enables parallel computation that makes it so fast and hence extremely useful. Go through the following resources to familiarize yourselves with it.

- [**Official Quickstart**](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)
- **[W3 Schools: NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp) (Recommended)**
- [**FreeCodeCamp: Python NumPy Tutorial for Beginners**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI&pp=ygUObnVtcHkgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D) (Video tutorial)

## Neural Networks

### **Strongly Recommended**

**Finish [this course "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) by Andrew Ng on Coursera and complete the video tutorials by the end of this week.**

You do not need to enrol for the course, you can audit all the content for free.

- You may also watch [**this 4 video infographic series by 3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) to better understand a lot of the math behind neural networks

## PyTorch

PyTorch is another powerful library we'll be using to implement our neural networks. Again, you do not require an in-depth knowledge of this module, just a basic understanding of the syntax and the specific functions we'll be using.

- [**PyTorch tutorial**](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) for the basic functions you'll need to build the classifier.
